 As is the case with point mutations, the most common type of sequencing
 error occurs when a single nucleotide from a read is interpreted incorrectly.

 Given: A collection of up to 1000 reads of equal length (at most 50 bp) in
 FASTA format. Some of these reads were generated with a single-nucleotide error.
 For each read s in the dataset, one of the following applies:
    s was correctly sequenced and appears in the dataset at least twice
	   (possibly as a reverse complement);
    s is incorrect, it appears in the dataset exactly once, and its
	  Hamming distance is 1 with respect to exactly one correct read 
	  in the dataset (or its reverse complement).

 Return: A list of all corrections in the form "[old read]->[new read]". 
 (Each correction must be a single symbol substitution, and you may return the corrections in any order.)
